    \title{An adaptive DNS/LES for a Shallow Water Equation model of the ocean}

    \begin{abstract}
      Meso-scale eddies are present in only small portions of the oceans,
      however they contain significant portions of the oceans' kinetic energy.
      For this reason it is important to resolve meso-scale eddies, however
      meso-scale eddies are of the order of 10km, and thus for a structured grid
      general ocean circulation model, requiring a rigid mesh size, it is not
      feasible to completely resolve such features on any of todays computers.
      While the Finite Element Method can be used on unstructured grids, and
      therefore allows for the easy refinement of meshes, for resolving such
      features as meso-scale eddies and western boundary currents, which move
      about continuously, a dynamic approach to mesh refinement is necessary. In
      this paper we develop an Adaptive DNS/LES model for the Shallow Water
      Equations of the Ocean, which allows for resolving important features
      while under-resolving features seen as less important.
