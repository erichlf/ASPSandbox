Let $\Omega \times I$ be the problem domain with $\Gamma$ the boundary of
$\Omega$ and $I = [0, T]$.  Then the inviscid linear shallow water equations are
given by \cite{Hanert2004, LeBlond1981, Le-Roux1998}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \mathbf{u}_t + f\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{u} + g \nabla \eta = 0, \\
    \eta_t + H \nabla\cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,
  \end{split}
  \label{eqn:SWE}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}$ is the two-dimensional velocity vector, $\eta$ is the
fluid elevation, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\mathbf{k}$ is a unit
vector in the vertical direction, and $H$ is the constant depth of the fluid.
For a domain with hard boundaries we solve these equations subject to the
boundary condition
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{n} = 0 \quad \text{on } \Gamma,
  \label{eqn:BCs}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward normal at the boundary,
and initial condition
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{u}, \eta = \mathbf{u}_0, \eta_0 \quad \text{for } t = 0.
  \label{eqn:IC}
\end{equation}
