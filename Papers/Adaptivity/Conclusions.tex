In this report we presented a new approach to automate goal-oriented error
control to solutions of partial differential equations. We demonstrated the
effectiveness of this approach on linear and non-linear problems. In particular,
we show that the method is more effective when the chosen functional is a
measure of local phenomenon as opposed to a more global phenomenon, since the
adaptivity turns out to be similar to uniform refinement.
