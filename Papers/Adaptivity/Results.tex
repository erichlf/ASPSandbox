In this section we present a detailed computational study of the automated
goal-oriented adaptive algorithm presented in \autoref{sec:Algorithm} applied to
some time-dependent test problems. To this end we first we apply our algorithm
to a linear problem where the error representation is orthogonal due to Galerkin
orthogonality. Namely, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
\autoref{alg:Adaptivity} on the heat equation. Second, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the new algorithm on the 2D Navier-Stokes equations
discretized using the a Galerkin/least-squares (GLS) stabilized finite element
with continuous piecewise linear basis functions (cG(1)). Third, we apply our
algorithm to the Variable Density Navier-Stokes equation discetized using the
GLS-cG(1) finite element.
